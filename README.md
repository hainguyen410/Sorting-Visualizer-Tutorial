# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a tutorial-based implementation of Clement Mihailescu's [Sorting Visualizer project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer). I have forked the original project and worked on enhancing and understanding its functionality. This project is a part of my portfolio, showcasing my understanding of sorting algorithms and React.

## Project Overview

The Sorting Visualizer allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms. The code for the visualization logic and the algorithms is located under `/src/SortingVisualizer` and `/src/sortingAlgorithms`. The SortingVisualizer component is imported and rendered in `App.js`.

## Features

- **Visualizes Sorting Algorithms**: Watch how different algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort work in real-time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Customize array size, speed, and more to see how algorithms handle different scenarios.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across various screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing sorting algorithms and handling interactivity.
- **CSS**: For styling the visualizer and making it responsive.

## How to Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms to the visualizer.
- Implement user-defined input arrays for sorting.
- Improve UI/UX with advanced features like dark mode.
